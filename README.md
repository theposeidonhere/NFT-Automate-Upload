# Message for a MacOS user
You might need to remove the quarantine attribute from the chromedriver, I did this by issuing the following command in the Terminal: 
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Auto_Chrome_2-main/chromedrivers/chromedriver

You might also need to add the chromedriver to the mac Firewall exception list like so:

System Preferences > Security & Privacy > (Unlock the padlock if necessary) Firewall options > click on the + icon and locate the chromedriver
